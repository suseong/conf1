\section{INTRODUCTION}

Transient. Disturbance. Model uncertainties. and so on.

\section{Quadrotor dynamics and control}

\subsection{Quadrotor dynamics}
To describe the dynamic model of a multirotor, the inertial $O_I\{x_I,y_I,z_I\}$ and the multirotor body-fixed $O_b\{x_b,y_b,z_b\}$ frames are defined. The body-fixed frame is located at the center of mass of the multirotor. 
The translational and angular dynamics of a multirotor is described as follows:
\begin{align}
%\ddot{x} &= ge_3 + \frac{T}{m}\textbf{q}\odot e_3 \label{eq:translational} \\
%\ddot{x} &= ge_3 + T\textbf{q}\otimes \text{P}(e_3)\otimes\textbf{q}^{-1} + \Delta \label{eq:translational} \\
\ddot{x} &= gz_I + Tz_b + \Delta \label{eq:translational} \\
\dot{\textbf{q}} &= \textstyle{\frac{1}{2}}\textbf{q}\otimes \text{P}(\omega) \label{eq:rotational}
\end{align}
where $x$ is the position of $O_b$ with respect to $O_a$, and $\textbf{q} = [q_0\;\bar{q}^\intercal]^\intercal$ is the unit quaternion describing the orientation of $O_b$ with respect to $O_a$.
The angular velocity of $O_b$ represented in $O_b$ is denoted as $\omega$.
The disturbance and model uncertainties are lumped in $\Delta \in \mathbb{R}^{3\times 1}$. 
The terms $g$ and $T$ are gravitational constant and mass normalized collective thrust, respectively. Without loss of generality, the $z_I$ axis is defined as $e_3 = [0\;0\;1]^\intercal$. Also, the operator $\otimes$ represents quaternion multiplication, $\text{P}(\cdot)$ is the quaternion representation of a vector $\bar{r} \in \mathbb{R}^{3\times 1}$ as $\text{P}(\bar{r}) = [0\;\bar{r}^\intercal]^\intercal$. 

In the quadrotor dynamics, the rotational motion of a quadrotor is described with the kinematic relation. It is possible based on the assumption that the body angular velocity could be directly controlled with some low-level controller such as [Matthias] or off-the-shelf flight controller compatible with angular rate mode control.
Therefore, the input terms are the terms $T$ and $\omega$.
\\
\textbf{Uncertainty and disturbances}
In the free flight scenario, rotor drag and fuselage drag could be considered as the biggest external disturbances.
The rotor drag could be modeled as, and the fuselage drag could be blah blah.

\subsection{Quadrotor control}
Assume that the differential flat output of a multirotor, which are $\{x(t)^r,y(t)^r,z(t)^r,\psi^r(t)\}$, are given.
Here, $\psi$ represents the reference rotation of a multirotor about $z_b$ axis.

To control the translational motion of a multirotor, we utilized geometric control method [TYL]. 
Define the reference trajectory as $x^r(t)$.
Let $e_p = x - x_r$ and $e_v = \dot{x} - \dot{x}_r$ represent position and velocity error with respect to the reference trajectory.
With the above definitions, the mass normalized thrust $T$  and desired thrust direction of a multirotor $z_b^d$ could be computed as the following procedure:
\begin{align}
\ddot{x}^{d} &= -K_p e_p - K_v e_v -ge_3 + \ddot{x}^r \nonumber \\
%z_b^{d} &= \frac{\ddot{x}^{d}}{\|\ddot{x}^{d}\|} \nonumber \\
z_b^{d} &= \ddot{x}^{d}/|\ddot{x}^{d}| \nonumber \\
T &= \ddot{x}^{d}\cdot z_b = |\ddot{x}^{d}|z_b^d \cdot z_b. \nonumber 
\end{align}
By substituting the terms $T$ and $z_b^d$ in \eqref{eq:translational}, the error dynamics of the translational motion could be derived as follows:
\begin{align}
\ddot{e}_p &= ge_3 + Tz_b + \Delta - \ddot{x}^r + \ddot{x}^d - \ddot{x}^d \nonumber \\
%&= ge_3 + \ddot{x}^d + \Delta -\ddot{x}^r + Tz_b - \ddot{x}^d \nonumber \\
&= -K_pe_p -K_ve_v + \Delta + Tz_b - \ddot{x}^d \nonumber \\
%&= -K_pe_p -K_ve_v + \Delta + |\ddot{x}^d|(z_b^d\cdot z_b)z_b - |\ddot{x}^d|z_b^d \nonumber \\
&= -K_pe_p -K_ve_v + \Delta + |\ddot{x}^d|\{(z_b^d\cdot z_b)z_b - z_b^d\}. \nonumber
\end{align}
The term inside of the curly bracket could be represented as $\text{s}_\Phi \bar{u}$ with some unit vector $\bar{u}$ as drawn in fig. 2.

Similarly, the rotational motion of a multirotor could be analyzed by combining it with a control law for $\omega^d$. 
First, we compute the desired multirotor body frame with $\psi(t)$ and $z_b^d$ as follows:
\begin{align}
\bar{y}_b &= [\begin{array}{ccc}-\text{s}_{\psi^r}&\text{c}_{\psi^r}&0\end{array}]^\intercal \nonumber \\
x_b^d &= \text{S}(\bar{y}_b)z_b^d / \|\text{S}(\bar{y}_b)z_b^d \| \nonumber \\ 
y_b^d &= \text{S}({z}_b^d)x_b^d / \|\text{S}(z_b^d)x_b^d \|. \nonumber  
\end{align}
Then, based on the axes $\{x_b^d,y_b^d,z_b^d\}$, the desired coordinate could be represented with the unit quaternion $\textbf{q}^d$. 
The attitude error between $\textbf{q}^d$ and $\textbf{q}$ is denoted as $\textbf{q}_e = \textbf{q}^{-1}\otimes \textbf{q}^d$. To decrease the attitude error $\textbf{q}_e = [q_e\;\bar{q}_e^\intercal]^\intercal$, the angular velocity is set as 
\begin{equation}
\omega = \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
\omega_d^d - k_p \bar{q}_e & \text{if  }\;q_e \geq 0, \\ 
\omega_d^d + k_p \bar{q}_e & \text{if  }\;q_e < 0. \\ 
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}
where $\omega_d^d$ is the desired angular velocity of $\textbf{q}^d$ represented in $\textbf{q}^d$.
According to [ETH], the attitude error $\textbf{q}_e$ is globally asymptotically stable equilibrium point. Based on that, it is possible to assume that the error $\Phi$ is also asymptotically stable, and bounded by certain value $\Phi_\text{max}$.

\subsection{Stability analysis}
The attitude error is globally asymptotically stable.
The translational position and velocity error, which is denoted as $e = [e_p^\intercal\;e_v^\intercal]^\intercal$ could be considered as input-to-state stable by considering $\Phi$ and $\Delta$ as input terms. 
\begin{equation}
\dot{e} = Ae
 + B\{\Delta+|\ddot{x}^d|\text{s}_\Phi\bar{u}\} \label{eq:translationalError} 
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
A = \left[
\begin{array}{rr}
0_{33} & I_3 \\ -K_p & -K_d 
\end{array}
\right],\;\;\;B = \left[
\begin{array}{r}
0_{33} \\ I_3
\end{array}
\right]. 
\end{equation}

Since the system matrix $A$ is Hurwitz, we can find the positive definite matrix $P$ satisfying $PA + A^\intercal P < 0$, and define $Q = -\frac{1}{2}(PA +A^\intercal P)$. 
Furthermore, it is assumed that the axis $z_b$ tracks $z_b^d$ with sufficient accuracy so that the following condition is satisfied.
\begin{equation}
\text{s}_\Phi \leq {\frac{\nu}{\eta_p\eta_k}} \label{eq:angleCondition}
\end{equation}
where 
$\nu = \lambda_{\min}(Q)$, $\eta_p = \lambda_{\max}(P)$, and $\eta_k = \lambda_{\max}(\text{blockdiag}\{K_p,K_v\})$.
Then, with the Lyapunov candidate function $V = \frac{1}{2}e^\intercal P e$, the stability analysis on eq. \eqref{eq:translationalError} is done as follows: 
\begin{align}
\dot{V} &= \textstyle{\frac{1}{2}}e^\intercal (PA + A^\intercal P)e + e^\intercal P B (\Delta + \text{s}_\Phi|\ddot{x}^d|\bar{u}) \nonumber \\
&= -e^\intercal Q e \label{eq:lyapForFunnel} \\
&\;\;\;\; + e^\intercal P B (\Delta + \text{s}_\Phi |-K_p e_p - K_v e_v +ge_3+{\ddot{x}}^r|\bar{u}) \nonumber  \\
&\leq -\nu |e|^2 + \eta_p|e|\{\bar{\Delta}+\text{s}_\Phi(\eta_k|e|+|ge_3 + \ddot{x}^r|)\} \nonumber \\
&\leq (-\nu + \text{s}_\Phi\eta_p\eta_k)|e|^2 + \eta_p\{\bar{\Delta} + \text{s}_\Phi|ge_3+\ddot{x}^r|\}|e|. \nonumber 
\end{align}
With the condition in eq. \eqref{eq:angleCondition}, it is clear that $-\nu+\text{s}_\Phi\eta_p\eta_k < 0$. To find the region of $|e|$ satisfying $\dot{V} < 0$, we rearrange the above equation as follows:
\begin{align}
\dot{V} &\leq (-\nu+\text{s}_\Phi\eta_p\eta_k)\theta|e|^2 + (-\nu+\text{s}_\Phi\eta_p\eta_k)(1-\theta)|e|^2 \nonumber \\
&\;\;\;\;\;+\eta_p\{\bar{\Delta} + \text{s}_\Phi |ge_3+\ddot{x}^r|\}|e| \nonumber 
\end{align}
where $0<\theta<1$. 
Then, 
\begin{equation}
\dot{V} \leq (-\nu+\text{s}_\Phi\eta_p\eta_k)\theta|e|^2,\;\;\; \forall |e| \geq L \left[\begin{array}{l}\bar{\Delta} \\ |ge_3+\ddot{x}^r|\end{array}\right] \nonumber 
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
L = \frac{\eta_p}{(\nu-\text{s}_\Phi\eta_p\eta_k)(1-\theta)}[\begin{array}{cc}1 & \text{s}_\Phi \end{array}]. \nonumber
\end{equation}
Therefore, eq. \eqref{eq:translationalError} could be considered as an input-to-state stable system with the norm of disturbance $\bar{\Delta}$ and nominal mass normalized collective thrust $|ge_3 + \ddot{x}^r|$ as input terms.
Also, the norm of $L$ is a monotonic function of $\text{s}_\Phi$. By increasing the attitude error, the norm of $L$ will be bigger. 
Accordingly, the error $|e|$ will be bounded with larger radius. 
It implies that the attitude control should be achieved as accurate as possible. 

\section{Computing funnels}
Heretofore, the stability of the translational motion of a multirotor has been analyzed. 
After transient period, the error $|e|$ will be bounded and the radius of the bound is determined by the norm of disturbance, norm of the nominal thrust, and the attitude control quality. 
Even though we know how the error would behave and the radius of bound in conservative manner [KHALIL], we cannot find the tight bound of the error state with the above analysis. 

However, with the funnel analysis with sum of squares optimization tools, we can find the realistic outermost bound on the state $e$.
The concept of funnel and numerical method for computing funnel are mainly adopted from [MAJ]. 
\subsection{Funnel?}
Funnel represents the outermost bound of the set of error $e(t)\in \xi$ given the initial set of error $|e(0)| \in \xi_0$ and the dynamic equation such as eq.\eqref{eq:translationalError}.
% gain matrices in the controller $K$, the maximum bound on disturbance $|\Delta| < \bar{\Delta}$, and the accuracy level on the attitude control $|\text{s}_\Phi| < \bar{\text{s}}_\Phi$.
In other words, the set of error with initial condition $e(0) \in \xi_0$ will evolve inside of the funnel $\mathcal{F}(t) \subset \mathbb{R}^{6\times 1}$.
These property of the funnel could be written as follows:
\begin{equation}
e(t_0) \in \xi_0,\;\xi_0 \subset \mathcal{F}(0)\;\Rightarrow\; e(t) \in \mathcal{F}(t),\;\;\forall t \geq t_0. \label{eq:funnel1}
\end{equation}
Define a time varying positive definite matrix $P_\mathcal{F}(t) \in \mathbb{R}^{6\times 6}$, a positive parameter $\alpha(t) \in \mathbb{R}$, and $V_\mathcal{F}(t,e) = \frac{1}{2}e(t)^\intercal P_\mathcal{F}(t) e(t)$.
In the following analysis, $V_\mathcal{F}(t,e)$ will be the new Lyapunov function, and $\alpha(t)$ will be the parameter indicating the level of $V_\mathcal{F}(t,e)$.
%Let us suppose that $\dot{V}_\mathcal{F}(t,e) < \dot{\alpha}(t)$ holds for $t \in [t_0,t_f]$ and $e$ satisfying $V_\mathcal{F}(t,e) = \alpha(t)$.
%Then, it is obvious that the state $e$ cannot escape from the sublevel set described by $V_\mathcal{F}(t,e) = \alpha(t)$.
Then, with $V_\mathcal{F}(t,e)$ and $\alpha(t)$, define a set $\mathcal{F}(t)$ as 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{F}(t) = \{e(t) \in \mathbb{R}^{6\times 1} | V_\mathcal{F}(t,e) \leq \alpha(t)\}. \label{eq:funnel2}
\end{equation}
%Here, for $\hat{e}(t) = \{e|V_\mathcal{F}(t,e) = \alpha(t),\;t\in[t_0,t_f]\}$, let us assume that $V_\mathcal{F}$ and $\alpha$ are constrained such as
%\begin{equation}
%\dot{V}_\mathcal{F}(t,e) < \dot{\alpha}(t)\text{ and }V_\mathcal{F}(t,e) = \alpha(t). \label{eq:funnel3}
%\end{equation}
Here, let us assume that $V_\mathcal{F}$ and $\alpha$ are constrained such as
\begin{align}
&\dot{V}_\mathcal{F}(t,\hat{e}) < \dot{\alpha}(t), \label{eq:funnel3} \\
&\text{for }\;\;\;\hat{e}(t) = \{e(t)|V_\mathcal{F}(t,e) = \alpha(t),\;t\in[t_0,t_f]\}. \nonumber
\end{align}
Then, it is obvious that the state $e(t) \in \mathcal{F}(t)$ cannot escape from the sublevel set described by $V_\mathcal{F}(t,e) \leq \alpha(t)$.
Therefore, with the set defined in eq. \eqref{eq:funnel2} and constraints in eq. \eqref{eq:funnel3}, 
the set $\mathcal{F}(t)$ complies with the definition of funnel in eq. \eqref{eq:funnel1} [MAJ]. 
Another constraint to fulfill the property of funnel defined in eq. \eqref{eq:funnel1} is related on the initial condition of a funnel. 
At $t = t_0$, the initial set of $e(t_0)$ should be the subset of $\mathcal{F}(t_0)$. 
%so that we can see how all the error state in $e(t_0) \in \xi_0$ progress as time goes on. 
To satisfy the constraint, we define the initial set of $e(t_0)$ with a positive definite matrix $R$ as follows:
\begin{equation}
\xi_0 = \{e(t_0) \in \mathbb{R}^{6\times1}|e(t_0)^\intercal R e(t_0) \leq 1\}.
\end{equation} 
In addition, we want to find $V_\mathcal{F}$ and $\alpha$ that represent the tight outer bound of $e$. 
Since $P_\mathcal{F}$ is a positive definite matrix and $V_\mathcal{F}$ is a quadratic function of $e$, 
it is possible to find the ellipsoid that enclosing the level set defined as $V_\mathcal{F}(t,e) = \alpha(t)$.
Then, if we can minimize the size of the outer shell, the size of the funnel could naturally be minimized consequently.
The outer ellipsoid can be formulated such as
\begin{align}
&\hat{e}^\intercal S(t) \hat{e} \leq 1,\;S(t) \in \mathbb{R}^{6\times 6}, \nonumber \\
&\text{ for }\;\;\;\hat{e}(t) = \{e(t)|V_\mathcal{F}(t,e) \leq \alpha(t),\;t \in [t_0,t_f]\}. \nonumber
\end{align}
where $S(t)$ is the positive definite matrix representing the shape of the outer shell, and the volume of the ellipsoid is proportional to the determinant of $S(t)$.

Based on these observations, we can formulate the optimization to find the tight funnel as follows:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rl}
\displaystyle{\inf_{P_\mathcal{F},\alpha}} & \int_{t_0}^{t_f} \det{S(t)}^{1/6}\text{d}t \nonumber \\
\displaystyle{\text{s.t.}}& \dot{V}_\mathcal{F}(t,\hat{e}) < \dot{\alpha},\text{ for }\hat{e} = \{e|V_\mathcal{F}(t,e) = \alpha(t)\}, \nonumber \\
& \hat{e}^\intercal S(t) \hat{e} \leq 1,\text{ for }\hat{e} = \{e|V_\mathcal{F}(t,e) \leq \alpha(t)\}, \nonumber \\
& \xi_0 \subset \mathcal{F}(0,e).
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\subsection{implementing into a numerical solver}
\begin{align}
\dot{V}_\mathcal{F} &= -e^\intercal Q_\mathcal{F} e \nonumber \\
&\;\;\;+e^\intercal P_\mathcal{F} B(\Delta+\text{s}_\Phi|-Kpe_p -K_ve_v + ge_3 + \ddot{x}^r|\bar{u}) \nonumber
\end{align}

\begin{align}
|&e^\intercal P_\mathcal{F} B(\Delta+\text{s}_\Phi|-K_p e_p -K_v e_v + ge_3 + \ddot{x}^r|\bar{u})| \nonumber \\
&\leq |e^\intercal P_\mathcal{F}B|\{\bar{\Delta} + \bar{\text{s}}_\Phi(k_p|e_p| + k_v|e_v| + |ge_3+\ddot{x}^r|\} \nonumber \\
&\leq (p_\mathcal{F}^{pv}|e_p|+p_\mathcal{F}^v|e_v|)\nonumber \\
&\;\;\;\;\;\times \{\bar{\Delta}+\bar{\text{s}}_\Phi(k_p|e_p|+k_v|e_v|+|ge_3+\ddot{x}^r|)\} \nonumber \\
&\leq (p_\mathcal{F}^{pv}\bar{e}_p+p_\mathcal{F}^v\bar{e}_v)\{\bar{\Delta}+\bar{\text{s}}_\Phi(k_p\bar{e}_p+k_v\bar{e}_v+|ge_3+\ddot{x}^r|)\} \nonumber 
\end{align}

Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity ÒMagnetizationÓ, or ÒMagnetization, MÓ, not just ÒMÓ. If including units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only with units. In the example, write ÒMagnetization (A/m)Ó or ÒMagnetization {A[m(1)]}Ó, not just ÒA/mÓ. Do not label axes with a ratio of quantities and units. For example, write ÒTemperature (K)Ó, not ÒTemperature/K.Ó
